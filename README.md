# fetching of data
Description:-
Basic Table: This refers to a fundamental structure used in web development to organize and display data in rows and columns. In this context, it implies creating a simple grid-like structure to present information about employees and their salaries.

Shows Employees Salary: This indicates that the table's purpose is to display information about employees and their corresponding salaries. Each row in the table will likely represent an individual employee, and the columns will include relevant details like name, position, and salary.

Using Node.js: Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to execute JavaScript code on the server-side. In this context, it implies that the code for creating and populating the table will be written in JavaScript using Node.js. This suggests that the application is likely to be a server-side script, not a client-side script running in a web browser.

Implementation Complexity: The term "basic" implies that the table creation and salary display functionality will be relatively straightforward. It may not involve complex features like sorting, filtering, or dynamic updates, focusing instead on a simple representation of data.

Backend Development: The use of Node.js suggests that this implementation is likely to be part of a backend application. This means that it's designed to handle server-side tasks such as data retrieval, manipulation, and rendering HTML content, as opposed to client-side tasks like interactivity or UI updates.
